4. **Select "Download as zip"** from the dropdown menu

### Option 2: File Menu

2. **Run this command:**
   ```bash
   zip -r freedomstyle-website.zip . -x "node_modules/*" ".git/*" "*.log"
   ```
3. **Download the zip file** that gets created

## If You Can't Find the Dots:

The three dots (⋯) are usually located:
- **Next to your project/repl name** at the top
- **In the file browser** when you right-click
- **In the main menu** (hamburger menu ☰)

## Alternative: Copy Files Manually

If download doesn't work, you can copy the content of each file:

2. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Deployment script
3. `client/index.html` - Main HTML file
4. `client/src/App.tsx` - Main React app
5. `vite.config.client.ts` - Build configuration

### How to Copy:
1. Click on each file in Replit
2. Select all content (Ctrl+A)
3. Copy (Ctrl+C)
4. Create new file on your computer
5. Paste content and save

## After Getting Files:
1. Create GitHub repository named `freedomstyle`
2. Upload all files (except node_modules folder)
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Your website will be live!
